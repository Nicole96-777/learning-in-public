# learning-in-public
Documenting my progress in Computer Science and coding projects.

Hey there 👋 — I’m currently learning and building my skills in Computer Science through self-study and university coursework. This space is where I share my progress, challenges, and small wins.

### 🌱 Current Focus:
- Modular arithmetic & cryptography
- C++ projects
- Problem-solving with algorithms
- Personal portfolio prep

### 🛠️ Projects Coming Soon:
- Budget tracker (CLI-based)
- Mini RSA encryption/decryption tool
- Web-based journal using HTML/CSS/JS

### 🚀 Why I’m Doing This:
I want to grow into a developer who’s not only technically strong but also curious and creative. Learning in public keeps me accountable, and hopefully it helps someone else out too.

Thanks for stopping by!
